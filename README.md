# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer 
A Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a graphical application that provides a visual representation of various sorting algorithms in action. It allows users to see how different sorting techniques manipulate a set of data, typically a list of numbers, to arrange them in ascending or descending order. This visualisation aids in understanding the internal workings of sorting algorithms and their efficiency.

# Types of Sorting Algorithms
Bubble Sort: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.

Insertion Sort: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking elements from the input data and inserting them into their correct position within the sorted portion of the array.

Selection Sort: Divides the input list into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted region.

Merge Sort: Divides the unsorted list into sublists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.

Quick Sort: Selects a 'pivot' element and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.

# Visualisation in Sorting Algorithms
Visualisation in sorting algorithms refers to the process of representing the steps and actions of a sorting algorithm using graphical elements. It provides a visual representation of how the algorithm manipulates a set of data to arrange it in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending order. Visualisation is a valuable educational and analytical tool that allows individuals to see the inner workings of sorting algorithms, understand their performance, and identify potential optimizations.

# User Interaction
The user interaction elements in a Sorting Algorithm Visualizer empower users to actively participate in the learning and observation process. Users can select their preferred sorting algorithm, input their own data for sorting, and customize the speed of the visualization. This level of interactivity enhances the user's understanding of sorting algorithms and enables them to explore how different algorithms perform on different datasets. It provides a more engaging and educational experience for users interested in learning and experimenting with sorting algorithms.
